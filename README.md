> *We reveal that inter-class correlations impairs CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations to reduce inter-class
correlations.
Additionally, we leverage two additional branches to strengthen final patch features. Finally, we update segmentation maps with generated masks to improve spatial consistency. CorrCLIP achieves
superior performance across eight benchmarks.*
